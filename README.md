# Prolog Assignments Repository

This repository contains a collection of Prolog-based assignments, covering various logic programming concepts such as recursion, backtracking, list processing, and knowledge representation. Each assignment demonstrates the power of declarative programming by solving real-world problems using Prolog.

## Assignments Included ðŸ“Œ

âœ… **Football League Stats** â€“ Analyze players, teams, and matches using Prolog queries  
âœ… **Drone Delivery Route Planner** â€“ Optimal pathfinding algorithm for package delivery using DFS (Depth-First Search)

### Drone Delivery Route Planner Features:
- Implements a depth-first search algorithm to find optimal delivery routes
- Handles obstacles and package locations in a grid world
- Tracks visited packages to maximize deliveries
- Visualizes the drone's path through the grid
- Demonstrates Prolog's backtracking capabilities for pathfinding

## How to Use
1. Clone this repository
2. Run the Prolog files in your preferred Prolog environment (SWI-Prolog recommended)
3. Call the main predicate (usually `start/0`) to execute each program

## Requirements
- SWI-Prolog or compatible Prolog implementation
- Basic understanding of logic programming concepts
